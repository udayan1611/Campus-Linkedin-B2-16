                    I used a discussion forum to offer students a structured opportunity to interact with each other online around exam time. For the purpose of reviewing for the exam students posted questions they had about course material, and other students answered them in the online forum. I also agreed to weigh in on student comments after each question had received at least one response from another student. I had a few reasons for my decision to use the forum in this way. First, I knew that I would not have enough time to answer all of my students’ questions around exam time as I was preparing for my own qualifying exams during the same semester. I was also fairly certain that my students could be effective in teaching each other and answering one another’s questions; I wanted them to depend more on each other and less on me in the time leading up to the exam. By using an online discussion, I hoped to encourage collaboration and to give students a structured opportunity to work together to find the answers to questions that they were having difficulty with. This activity would also have another desired benefit — it would help students to practice writing and explaining concepts prior to doing so on the exam.

                            Post a question you have about material from the course.
                            Articulate your thinking about the question: What do you know already? What is confusing you? If you had to answer this question right now, how would you answer?
                            Wait for at least one student to weigh in on your question.
                            I will respond after one student has commented on your question.
